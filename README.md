# Simple Sound Machine

## Description
I built this sound machine as a project given through FreeCodeCamp. I used VScode and the Live server extension to do all my coding. The sound machine is able to play 9 unique sounds by pressing the correct keys on a keyboard or by manually clicking the buttons. There is also an added feature which records the sounds played and provides the options to replay or clear the recording.

I used React, Javascript, Bootstrap and Babel in order to practice Front End Development and using Front End Libraries. In the future, I hope to make the app more visually pleasing and add features that will let users add their own sounds to play.
